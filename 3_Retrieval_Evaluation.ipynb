    "# Retrieval Evaluation - Process\n",
    "***\n",
    "Here's a high-level overview of how the Retrieval Evaluation process in this notebook works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate a \"golden dataset\" of query-context pairs.  Used a pseudo-LlamaIndex implementation for this step. 100 document chunks (contexts) were randomly selected from the Impact Theory corpus and those chunks were then submitted to the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model which generated a query that could be answered by the context.  The output was 100 query-context pairs along with associated doc_ids. \n",
    "   - **Assumptions**:\n",
    "     - The generated query-context pairs are, in fact, relevant to one another i.e. the query can be answered by the context that it's paired with\n",
    "     - The generated queries are simliar in style and length to the type of queries that end users would ask\n",
    "2. The golden dataset consists of three primary keys: `corpus`, `relevant_docs`, and `queries`\n",
    "     - The `corpus` is the original text context/chunk with it's associated `doc_id`\n",
    "     - The `queries` are the LLM generated queries, one (or more) for each entry in the `corpus`\n",
    "     - The `relevant_docs` is a simple lookup table linking the `corpus` docs to the generated `queries`\n",
    "3. We pass the golden dataset into a retrieval evluation function which does the following:\n",
    "   - Takes in a `retriever` arg (`WeaviateClient`) and a few other configuration params\n",
    "   - Iterates over all queries in the golden dataset and retrieves search results for each query from Weaviate datastore\n",
    "   - Extracts all `doc_id` values from the retrieved results\n",
    "   - Extracts the `doc_id` from the associated `relevant_docs` for each query\n",
    "   - Checks if the relevant doc_id is in the list of retrieved result doc_ids\n",
    "   - After all queries are completed a `hit_rate` score and `mrr` score are calculated for the entire golden dataset\n",
    "   - Writes results to an `eval_results` folder\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In a Nutshell\n",
    "Ulitmately, given a golden dataset consisting of queries, relevant docs, and their associated doc_ids, the `retrieval_evaluation` function is checking if the relevant doc_id is found in the list of retrieved results doc_ids, for each query.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problems with this Approach\n",
    "The problems with this approach are many:\n",
    "- The **Assumptions** (see section 1 above) about the golden dataset must hold true.  Given that the pairs are generated by `gpt-3.5-turbo`, I think the first assumption will generally be true.  The 2nd assumption though, is going to be dependent on your particular search use case.\n",
    "- This approach is conservative in that there is only \"one\" right answer.  Either the relevant `doc_id` is in the results list or it isn't.  In reality, there are going to be several documents that could potentially answer the generated query, but we have no way to account for these other relevant documents, unless of course, we want to manually add doc_ids to the golden dataset (and depending on your business case, you may actually want to do that).\n",
    "- We aren't measuring recall or precision because we aren't classifying other documents as \"negatives\".  As was just mentioned, the other documents in the results list may or may not be good matches, we just don't know.  Because we don't know, we can't really classify the other documents as \"negatives\".  So for this approach, we are measuring the 'hit rate' which is simply a count of the number of times that we found a relevant `doc_id` match in the results list and `Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)`.  We're using MRR over other metrics such as Mean Average Precision (MAP) because we are only looking at a [single relevant answer](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/127041/mean-average-precision-vs-mean-reciprocal-rank).  Hit rate is a good enough metric for determining if our retriever is retrieving quality results, and MRR will become more important later on when we add a Reranker to the mix.  "
