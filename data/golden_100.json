One is you can start the treatment in middle age, and really, that was first demonstrated with rapamycin. So that was done in 2009.

And because people are kept in the dark about that, then other people are able to use their superior knowledge in an open marketplace to garner more of the money. Or even worse, if the government is using money to either inflate the currency or to redistribute money, which basically is stealing from one person, and yes, I'm using that word very intentionally, to give to other people that have not earned that money. That creates all this contention about how the money should be used, where it should be going. There were people that were up in arms when the airline industry was bailed out, or the banks were bailed out in the 2008 collapse. But how many of us knew that the banks have actually paid that money back, and the government's actually made money off of the loans that they gave to the banks?

The only way that you're going to be able to work hard is if at a cellular level, you're rested and getting sleep. And then obviously, you can work a lot of hours.

Are you going to be happy with the maintenance? Are you going to be happy with the attention that you might get in this car that isn't what you really think it's going to be? Some of you will realize that it's not worth it at that point and you'll be happier in your Corolla, you'll be happier in your Central, whatever, you know.

The most harmful self-talk that anyone can ever use, and it will hold them back forever, is this isn't my fault.

Reinforcement learning is all based on this. And you don't need subjective experience for that. So these are really distinct capabilities.

Printing money is in a sense, like official counterfeiting. And the guy who is about the counterfeited dollar first, can spend that and get more of the purchasing power. And then eventually it makes its way through the system and the entire money supply gets marked down. And it's got less of its purchasing power with the 15th guy who's got it, okay. And so printing is not costless. What printing just does is it's like, basically, inflation is taxation. It's like, let's say you had, I don't know, $100 billion, okay, in the economy as a whole. And then the government prints another $100 billion. That's as if the government seized 50% of the wealth in the country. Does that make sense? Or at least 50% of the savings? Yes.",
        "ugT5VkFl4Xo_34": "They can no longer leave their growth to randomness, because if they do, they'll always be mediocre. And they realize, I gotta become something entirely above both of those. That's what most people don't see. We've made this binary false conversation, right? It's not a true sort of choice here. It's a false dichotomy, we call it, right? It's not strengths or weaknesses. Many of you, if you have a big dream, a huge goal, you gotta become something entirely above and beyond any strengths you even know about, feel, or own, and go way beyond any weaknesses you've ever even addressed or even you know about, because you're gonna discover so many new strengths and so many new weaknesses on the path that it's almost irrelevant what they are now. It's what's the goal, and build into that. I didn't know how to write. I get a lot of critics who are like literary guys about my books, because every book is different, right? Six books, all of them different. And the reason they all read differently is I am challenging myself as a writer to develop, to get better.",
        "eoZlLYbHjZI_33": "When I was a kid, my dad, he was my coach essentially. He was my dad. Of course, he's my coach. He still tries to be my coach for anything. But you're racing and you can turn around and look in the go-kart. And he used to get so pissed at me. And he would say, and I actually used, this was probably the most valuable thing I ever learned in my life because it was more of, it was a metaphor for everything. And he said, you look where your eyes go. And I was like, and he's like, so look forward, don't turn around. And I was like, okay. But isn't that a metaphor for everything? You look where your eyes go, just like where your mind goes. Wherever you set your point of reference on, your mental attention, your focus, that is where you're going. How are you going to have a positive life from negative thoughts? You can't. Because you're going to perpetuate more negative thoughts. And you're going to attract, vibrationally and frequency-wise, people that are thinking that same way.",
        "Se91Pn3xxSs_46": "Like, I don't think again, you know, I've got two kids, what does the world look like in five years, let alone 10 years? I have no idea. And I'm in the middle of this because it's just impossible to see the smartest people that I know, they used to be able to see years in advance. They can't see more than a year or two. And this sounds again, very apocalyptic. But then, like I said, we're going to get to the good bit in a second. In every crisis, there is opportunity. Our society is broken as it stands already. And I think this is a chance to reshape it for the better and solve a lot of the biggest problems that we've been facing because of our slow dumb AIs, because of our organizations and institutions that we are all frustrated with. And I think this is a big upgrade from it. The example I had to give is there's the amazing poem by Ginsburg Howell about Moloch, this Carthaginian demon of disorder. I think where that came in was text.",
        "xvB1my7Wm-A_28": "So you're actually able to shift gears, get to that parasympathetic rest and digest, calming down by getting some exercise in in the morning. And so how do we employ this, though? That's the question, because some people just like, you know, I can't exercise in the morning. And there's also people who exercise in the morning who might have terrible sleep. And it's because this is not like the magic bullet. This is a thing to stack in your condition. If you're doing this and then messing up the one I'm going to talk about next, you're probably not going to have the best sleep. So here's how to employ this. Just five minutes. And I tested this each morning. I do this five minutes of exercise. You know, I might be just jumping on a rebounder, you know, a little mini trampoline for five minutes. Go for a quick power walk. Do some Tabata, which is just four minutes and a little mobility work. And I guess most people don't know what Tabata is. High intensity interval training.",

        "pmWmGVFGrN0_56": "All those other natural chemicals, we call them bioactives, activate systems in your body that counteract the disease process. They'll work hard to try to protect you against the disease, whereas the soda, no such activation. So the soda's just degrading. Is it then the lack of the bioactives in the soda or is it... Because I've always assumed that sugar is the blunt force trauma that ends up killing you. If you're dying of metabolic disease, you have a sugar problem. You have intake in too many carbohydrates. Full stop, period. End of story. It's that simple. Or no. It's not that simple because, you know, effectively food is not sugar or no sugar, all right? And... But is metabolic disease sugar or no sugar? No. I think metabolic disease, there's enough chemical reactions tied to sugar, but tied to other chemical reactions that have nothing to do with sugar. It could be a domino effect. So I could give myself metabolic disease with fat. If your mission is achieving excellence, you must support your body. Introducing AG1."
